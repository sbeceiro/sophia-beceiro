		This week has been waaay more successful than last. I feel that I am <em>finally</em> starting to understand how to use jQuery Selectors. My site looks like Iâ€™m playing it safe considering I am really only manipulating CSS classes, but I felt that in order to keep the assignment well-designed I wanted to create a simplified reading space for the user. I removed the stark contrast of the white background and made the paragraph width shorter, and easier to read. I changed the font just to give the page a cleaner look.
