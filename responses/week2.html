"You, the Users", Kalli Retzepi<br>
“Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?”, Hito Steyerl<br><br>

I really enjoyed the reading “You, the Users,” by Kalli Retzepi because it was a reminder to me that it is important to critique most harshly, the people and things that are the most inspirational to you. It is very easy for someone to be influenced by the words and thought of people or corporations that they find inspiring. The first example that comes to mind for me is Apple. It is a company people flock to. There is always the argument from the “other side” about how their upgrades to their technology is nothing innovative, “Samsung’s cameras have been able to do that for years!” Even with other comparable phones and computers on the market for significantly less money, people still purchase Apple products. It’s easy for people to ignore critiques of the company, their software, and hardware. It’s important to remember that while the internet seems fully impartial, there is always a bias. The order in which a Google search populates results comes with a bias. It has even been pointed out that AI technology has a bias when processing facial recognition between a person of color and a white person. The only way to solve these issues is to remain critical, especially of the things you admire the most. 
For the second article, “Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?” by Hito Steyerl I personally felt that this was a very difficult read. I thought that at points the author would overcompensate with very elaborate comparisons that were not later explained or expanded upon. I don’t think I understood this article well enough to formulate any further opinions on it.
