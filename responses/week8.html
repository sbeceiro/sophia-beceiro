		<em>Reading & Responses due 03/10 </em><br>
		“The Library of Babel”, Jorge Luis Borges<br>
		“Tower Of Babylon”<br>
		“The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction”, Ursula K. Le Guin<br><br>

In the reading, “The Library of Babel” , by Jorge Luis Borges, the library reminds me of the internet. Endless vast corridors of information all organized into geometric shapes. There is also the comment of having only 25 characters, while the internet relies on much more than just 25 characters, the idea of being a coded language that has to be deciphered was interestingly similar. “Tower Of Babylon” also brings up the interesting idea of infinity. In this case, the physical tower was so tall it, “reaches for the vault of heaven.” I also relate this to the vastness and never-ending nature of the internet. Its connectivity to new pages and its continuous cycle of new uploads and content by people all over the world means that no one person could ever sort through it all and get to the end of it. In the writing by Le Guin, there is a questioning of the past. She claims that perhaps the spear was not the first tool made by man, but a carrier bag was. She proposes this idea which shifts our perspective as to how we look at humanity. How our feelings shift from that of aggression and dominance (the spear) to a more docile, gathering and sharing (carrier bag). This idea is similar to how I think of the internet, a vast plain of information that is sharable. The entire purpose of the internet is to ultimately share information with another person.

<em>Question:</em><br>
Does the vast nature of the internet scare you? On one hand, it means endless resources to be used to benefit learning, on the other hand, it could mean too much to ever go through or truly take full advantage of?
