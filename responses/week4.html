	<p><em>Reading & Responses due 02/11</em><br>
	“Metalogue: Why a Swan?”, Gregory Bateson<br>
	“Metaphors We Live By” Lakoff and Johnson<br><br>

	The readings cover the topics of metaphors, context, form, and interactivity. In my opinion, the web is a metaphor, that when properly interacted with, becomes a reality. Just like the idea of the dancer and the audience. Without each other, they are lost. A dancer with no audience is just practicing, and an audience with no dancer to watch is bored. Just as the internet without a user is just information sitting on a server, and a user without the internet… well, they just need to find a new source of information. It is a symbiotic relationship that could not exist or interact in any way without both parties. </p>
