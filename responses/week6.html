		<em>Broad Band</em>, Claire L. Evans<br><br>

	
Reading this chapter in <em>Broad Band</em> was very helpful in putting internet communication into perspective. How we communicate via the internet now is like second nature. Some people view the internet and computers as solely a tool for communication with others. Realizing that was not always the case is very interesting in seeing how far we have come with technology as a form of communication. It is also interesting to consider the fact that there was such an emphasis on the user as these early programs were being developed. It was all about adapting to the user, tailoring to their habits, being dynamic enough to change along with the user, and ultimately ensuring, “a humanistic, user-driven approach.” This idea compelled me to compare this to our current way of designing for the web and how it almost feels impersonal. A lot of apps and websites claim to be made for the user, but looking past that initial claim, there seems to be a lot on the underlying surface that is against the user, and not necessarily catering to us. For example, social media websites claim to be the epitome of personalized online presence, but the design is slowly being moved away from individual users to benefit mainly companies and corporations that now want to use the web as a tool for advertising and releasing very partial information.

<em>Question:</em><br>
What do you think the internet would look like today if more decisions were left up to the user? <br>
Could it make for an inaccessible web that can only be used by those who know how to customize it? <br>
Could it wreak havoc on the system that was so carefully created, leaving it in the hands of users who could do as they please?
