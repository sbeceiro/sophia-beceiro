“Fuck Content”, Michael Rock<br>
Reinfurt Knuth Typography<br><br>

In the article “Fuck Content”, by Michael Rock, his closing statement really stood with me. The writing starts by introducing the idea of content within design and how important (or unimportant) it is in relation to understanding and judging a piece of work. As a young designer this great debate is always on my mind. Part of me wants to make meaningless but beautiful work, to flex my aesthetic muscles. The other half of me says that work without a story behind it has never inspired anyone to do anything but make more meaningless work… I like that the meaning of an artist and their work does not weigh solely on one piece. Your ‘content’ can grow, build itself, and change constantly, as new work and ideas get pushed into fruition.

The reading about Knuth’s typography in relation to mathematics and how it eventually integrated into computer programming was very interesting. It was such an impactful way of designing digitally for print. My favorite part of the reading was the exploration of the Kadist Art Foundation’s logo. As a designer, all I could think about was the cost associated with an ever-changing logo… How could they create signage? Are they constantly re-printing collateral? How can they establish a brand? While thinking about all of this and projecting my worry onto this Parisian art organization, my adventurous side was eternally grateful to be reminded that people are willing to sacrifice convenience or cost to design and be a part of something cool and unique.

1- As young designers, are you worried about establishing clear content now or more concerned with exploring different kinds of design? <br>
2- If there was one typeface you could “take apart and put it back together for yourself,” what would it be?

	<p>My biggest struggle for this week's assignment (Assignment 1) was trying to vary my pages with limited usage of html tags. I felt as if my pages were really repetitive, I'm hoping that with next week's assignment I will be able to vary my pages more.<br><br>The reading for this week was an extremely helpful refresher in HTML. It was also helpful in understanding how to organize my website files locally on my computer.</p>
<p>P.S. I didn't realize responses were to be posted on the website... will make note of that for future assignments!</p>
