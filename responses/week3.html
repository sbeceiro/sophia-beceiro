	<h1>Week 3 Responses</h1>
	<p>My biggest struggle for this week's assignment (Assignment 1) was trying to vary my pages with limited usage of html tags. I felt as if my pages were really repetitive, I'm hoping that with next week's assignment I will be able to vary my pages more.<br><br>The reading for this week was an extremely helpful refresher in HTML. It was also helpful in understanding how to organize my website files locally on my computer.</p>
<p>P.S. I didn't realize responses were to be posted on the website... will make note of that for future assignments!</p>
